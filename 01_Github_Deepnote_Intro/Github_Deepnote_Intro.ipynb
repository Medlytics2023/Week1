Here are some examples of default shortcuts in Deepnote:\n  * run current cell and move cursor to next cell: shift + enter\n  * run current cell: Ctrl + Enter\n  * execute all cells: Ctrl + Shift + Enter\n  * stop execution: Ctrl + Shift + C\n  * delete cell: Ctrl + Shift + Backspace\n  * move cell up: Alt + Shift + Up\n  * move cell down: Alt + Shift + Down\n  * duplicate cell: Ctrl + Shift + D\n  * insert code cell above: Ctrl + J\n  * insert code cell below: Ctrl + K\n  * undo: Ctrl + Z\n  * redo: Ctrl + Y \n* Download your current notebook to your local drive using \"Download project as ZIP\" in the dropdown menu in the top left",

One person in your group must share their notebook with the others so that they can edit it and work on the same code. To share the notebook with others, follow the below steps.\n\n#### 1. Click the Share button (has a globe next to it) at the top right of your screen in Deepnote. Under \"Public access\", set the drop-down field to \"Edit\".\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Medlytics2021/Week1Public/master/Images/share.PNG)\n\n#### 2.

The link to share the notebook should have been copied to your clipboard.\n\n#### 3. Send the link to your group members so that they can join you in editing the notebooks for that day (via Discord or Zoom chat)\n\n#### 4. **Use the notebook submission Google Form to submit information about your group as well as the notebook link you are working at.
